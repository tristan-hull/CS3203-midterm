Screenshots and New Feature:
  The feature I decided to add was the ability to search through a friends list. In my screenshots you will see that you can walk through the process of sending a yo to a few people, and then bring brought back to the original screen. You can also see that by tapping the top search bar, you can type a name, and the list is filtered as it should be to make finding a friend a much faster process.

Logo: It is really simple, but it get's the point across and it's recognizable. The colors are incredibly important to me as well.

Ethical Issues
  1. People might prefer the simplicity of having to search through a list. This would be taking that away from them.
  2. When people downloaded the app, they likely liked it for the features that were present, and changing those features without the consent of a user might be an ethical conundrum. It is a small one, but it is worth considering.
  3. A search feature could allow users to be found by email or other forms of identificaton, which some users might not like and could be considered unethical.
  
Legal Issues 
  1. In Japan, the user has to be aware that their data could be collected. To implement the search feature, more data might need to be collected about the user than they had previously consented to, so this could cause problems during implementation.
  2. In Japan, the purpose of use of the data is not supposed to be changed beyond the original scope of use. To implement the search feature, the data would need to be used in a different way than originally planned, which could create legal issues as well.
  3. In Japan, businesses must also try to delete data when it is no longer required, so Yo might need to set an amount of time that would set an account for automatic deletion to get around this law.
  
Professional Issues:
  1. A large part of what makes Yo great is the simplicity, and the search feature draws away from this a little. 
  2. The app seems kind of playful, which isn't going to be taken seriously be professionals. It could be changed to be less of a toy and more of a really useful app.
  3. It is really challenging to get the hang of. I found myself almost deleting friends at times.
